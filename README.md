### Characters
- Game Character 1 - This character's description tells about the character's different aspects.  It also gives a little bit of the character's background.
- Game Character 2 - This is the character's arch enemy and tells about this character's aspects.  It also gives a little bit of the character's background story. 
- Etc Characters

### Environments
- Environment 1 - This environment is where Character 1 grew up and found out that they were the chosen one to go do something and defeat some other character.  It looks like a place where the character would grow up, so I'd go on describing that. 
- Environment 2- This environment is the first area where Character 1 needs to go to and get a sword, where they also meet an ancient spirit that decides to guide the character.  I'm also describing the style and look. 
- Environment 3 - This is another environment and would be described. 

### The Story
This is the story and it goes something like this.  A young character awakens one day to something bad happening.  Then as the bad thing is happening, the character finds out that they are the chosen one to go accomplish some goal.  Though there's an evil person that was acting as an obstacle to block the character from reaching their goal.  The character goes through the secret place, which is Environment 2, and finds a sword and a spirit to guide them.

### Resources
I'm planning to use the following resources to help me make my game.
1. Some YouTube Channel that covers my specific genre that I'd name and put a YouTube link to
2. Another general YouTube channel that I'd think would help me with things like UI and coding
3. The title and link to a book I find for free through the library that I could use and is specific to my genre. 
4. A Unity Store Asset of a game that is prebuilt so that I can buy it and then learn from the code... not copy it, just use it to learn from...
