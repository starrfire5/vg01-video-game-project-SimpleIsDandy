### Game Mechanics

### Characters
- You - This character is yourself and you will be controlling everything. Your hands and arms are able to move. You are very hands on with everything.

### Environments
- The Kitchen - There will be a table where the slime will be placed on along with other items to go with the slime. The kitchen will be a nice, white and grey painted kitchen. The kitchen is the environment you make slime in.

### The Story
It's the weekend and you have nothing planned. You decide to go to the store to buy slime. You want to decorate the slime with different items you find at the store like sprinkles, beads, etc. You have a time limit to make the slime. If the time gets closer to ending you have to hurry before the slime comes to life and gets grumpy and splatters everywhere which will cause a mess in the kitchen.

### Unique Selling Points
1. This game offers an interaction with slime like never before!
2. This game allows you to be free and creative, but under a time limit.
3. Make some decorative slime before the time runs out or the slime monster will burst and splatter everywhere!

### Resources
I'm planning to use the following resources to help me make my game.
1. I'll use a youtube channel that will help me with learning coding certain movements into my game, preferably the lecture videos on Unity
2. I will be using the unity store to get certain items and characters for my game.
