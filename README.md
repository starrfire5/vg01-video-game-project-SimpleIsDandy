### Characters
- Doctor- 6 years of college graduated from UCLA. You're finally 6 months in at working at your new job at a hospital in LA. Everything is going well and you have a family of 3 including your wife. You're a very tidy and clean cut up person now apart from your past college experiences with a bad group of friends.

### Environments
- Basement- Dark low lit basement with a chair, some windows, brick wall, a lit candle, a table, a safe

### The Story
You wake up in a basement unaware of your surroundings. The last thing you remember is walking to your car when you got off of work from the hospital. Throughout your very limited time in the basement you pick out small details as to what happened before you got to the basement.

### Unique Selling Points
1. This game will have your mind thinking.

### Resources
I'm planning to use the following resources to help me make my game.
1. I'll use a youtube channel that will help me with learning coding certain movements into my game, preferably the lecture videos on Unity
2. I will be using the unity store to get certain items and characters for my game.
